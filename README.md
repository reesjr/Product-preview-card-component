### What I learned

i have learnt that the confidence from watching tutorial is very false and the best way of learning and mastery is by working on and taking challenges like those crafted by the frontend mentor team. Patience was another quality i developed as it took me a week to complete this challenge -patience is crucial as a developer!!


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I would definetily would want to focus more on responsive design as it was a real challenge in completing this task. I was able to navigate and get a better understanding by watching others build their projects and on ground help from answers gotten by developers on stackoverflow.
